//Question 35: Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

// 1st Step
let animals = ["Cat", "Dog", "Rabbit"]

console.log("\tList of Animals\n");

for(let i=0; i < animals.length; i++) {
  console.log(animals[i]);
}

// 2nd Step
console.log("\tStatement about each Animal\n");

for(let animal of animals) {
  switch (animal) {
    case "Cat": 
    console.log("Cats are beautiful and friendly animals.");
    break;
    case "Dog":
      console.log("Dogs are loyal, loving, hilarious and endless, forgiving creatures who have a knack of for warming our hearts.");
      break;
    case "Rabbit":
      console.log("Rabits are playful and very loyal to their masters.");
      break;
  }
};

console.log("\t Another Method\n")

     console.log(animal);
